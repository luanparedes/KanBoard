<<< KanBoard >>>

The idea is to have a generic kanban board.
The user can choose to have cards like a developer board with colums like "Todo", "In Progress", "Test", "Closed", etc.
But we can have other options like week days, that the user can add cards by day with daily activities.
Or we can have weekly boards, monthly, anual.
The Idea is to do a multi task app, with a music and video reproducer, a web browser, a text editor, etc.
